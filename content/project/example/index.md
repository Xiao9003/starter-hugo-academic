summary: In summary, phenazine-barbituric acid NIR fluorescent probes with only
  one fluorophore were developed for the ultrasensitive and selective detection
  of biothiols. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the barbituric
  acid moiety, **PBA** showed favorable NIR fluorescence and impressive
  colorimetric and ratiometric changes (over 158-fold) towards Cys in a pretty
  short time (within 60 seconds). The low LOD (74 nM), extraordinary sensitivity
  and selectivity provided **PBA** with the ability for detection in biological
  environments. Although the probe **PTA** with a stronger electron-withdrawing
  group showed a longer maximum absorption wavelength and higher sensitivity,
  the LOD and selectivity towards thiols were not satisfactory. So the
  probe **PBA** was successfully applied to detect endogenous Cys in living
  cells. Ratiometric fluorescence signals helped to discriminate Cys from Hcy
  and GSH in living cells. More importantly, **PBA** could be applied to
  fabricate the first TiO2 sensor devices by attaching to the interface of TiO2,
  which were employed to quantify the Hcy concentration in fetal bovine
  serum via the changes of the film absorption, paving a new way for the
  biological application of fluorescent probes.

A new colorimetric and ratiometric near-infrared fluorescent probe based on phenazine-barbituric acid was developed to ultrasensitively detect biothiols. The favorable ratiometric changes helped the imaging and differentiation of Cys in living cells. Besides, the probe was successfully employed to construct TiO2 sensor devices, which could quantify Hcy concentration in serum.
