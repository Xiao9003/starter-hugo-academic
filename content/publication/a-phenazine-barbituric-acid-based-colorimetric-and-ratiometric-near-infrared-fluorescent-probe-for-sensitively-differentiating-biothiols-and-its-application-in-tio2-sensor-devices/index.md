abstract: A new colorimetric and ratiometric near-infrared fluorescent probe
  based on phenazine-barbituric acid was developed to ultrasensitively detect
  biothiols. The favorable ratiometric changes helped the imaging and
  differentiation of Cys in living cells. Besides, the probe was successfully
  employed to construct TiO2 sensor devices, which could quantify Hcy
  concentration in serum.

  caption: Fig. 5 (A) Photographs of the optical devices before and after the
    reaction with different concentrations of Hcy in fetal bovine serum. (B) The
    film absorbance spectral changes in the optical devices with the increase of
    the Hcy concentration. (C) Plotting the absorption changes as a function of
    low concentrations (0–60 μM) for Hcy. A0 represented the initial membrane
    absorbance at 660 nm. A representation of the membrane absorbance at 660 nm.
    (D) The spiked (7.0, 13.0, 18.0 and 25.0 μM) and measured concentrations
    (7.3, 12.7, 18.1 and 24.5 μM) of Hcy in the serum. (E) Tautomerism of probe
